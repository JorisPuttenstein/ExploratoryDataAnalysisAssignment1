Exploratory Data Analysis assignment 1
Author: Joris Puttenstein
Date: 17-02-2020

1. Background
This repo is created for submitting an assignment for a Coursera-program called Exploratory Data Analysis.
The goal for this assignment was to reconstruct the previously given plots, by creating own code in R language.
The reconstructed images can be found in this repo.

2. Instructions
More detailed instructions are below:  
2.1. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.  
2.2. Name each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, etc.  
2.3. Create a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 constructs the 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐 plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.  
2.4. Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
